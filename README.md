# üõ†Ô∏è **Signify: Bridging the Communication Gap**  

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Problem Statement**  
Communication barriers exist between people who use sign language and those who don‚Äôt. Sign language users often struggle to express their needs or feelings in real time as most people cannot understand sign language. This creates gaps in accessibility, inclusivity, and effective interaction.  

### The Challenge:  
There‚Äôs a need for a solution to bridge this gap, enabling smooth communication and fostering understanding between signers and non-signers.
